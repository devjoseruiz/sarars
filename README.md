# Sara RS

Spanish chatterbot rewritten in RiveScript.

Sara is a Spanish chatterbot written in AIML by Adam Codony. This project aims to continue its development, rewriting it in a modern and more powerful language, RiveScript, adding some improvements on the fly.

> Note: the original code has been reduced from 15000 lines to just 1200, keeping the "brain" almost intact.


## Dependencies ##

- Perl
- RiveScript module for Perl


## Customization ##

All the Sara's variables are defined in the **begin.rive** file.


## Usage ##

You can try *Sara* by executing the **test.pl** file.

First you must install the RiveScript module for Perl:

```
cpan install RiveScript
```

Then double click or execute it by the console:

```
perl test.pl
```

And say whatever you want!

When you need exit, write the command "**/quit**".
